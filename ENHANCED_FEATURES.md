## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Core Classes

#### `ChessLearningEngine`
```typescript
class ChessLearningEngine {
  // Load chess literature
  async loadChessBook(book: ChessBook): Promise<void>
  
  // Train from master games
  async trainFromLiterature(agent: ChessAIAgent, options): Promise<void>
  
  // Enable online play
  async playOnlineGame(agent: ChessAIAgent, options): Promise<string>
}
```

#### Enhanced `ChessAIAgent`
```typescript
interface AgentKnowledge {
  // Traditional knowledge
  openingBook: Map<string, OpeningData>;
  positionEvaluations: Map<string, number>;
  tacticPatterns: Map<string, TacticalData>;
  endgameTablebase: Map<string, EndgameData>;
  
  // NEW: Literature knowledge
  literature: {
    booksStudied: string[];
    masterGamesAnalyzed: number;
    openingTheory: Map<string, TheoryData>;
    endgameStudies: Map<string, StudyData>;
  };
  
  // NEW: Online experience
  onlineExperience: {
    gamesPlayed: number;
    platforms: string[];
    winRate: { [platform: string]: number };
    averageOpponentRating: number;
    learningsFromGames: string[];
  };
}
```

### Data Structures

#### Chess Books
```typescript
interface ChessBook {
  title: string;
  author: string;
  games: PGNGame[];
  openings: OpeningTheory[];
  endgames: EndgameStudy[];
  tactics: TacticalPattern[];
}
```

#### Online Gaming
```typescript
interface OnlineGameConfig {
  platform: 'lichess' | 'chess.com' | 'fics';
  username: string;
  timeControl: { initial: number; increment: number };
  rating?: number;
}
```

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Loading Chess Literature
```typescript
import { chessLiteratureLibrary } from './lib/data/chessLiterature';

// Load a chess book
const mySystem = chessLiteratureLibrary.find(book => 
  book.title === "My System"
);
await trainingEngine.loadChessBook(mySystem);

// Train agent from literature
await trainingEngine.trainFromLiterature(agent, {
  focusAreas: ['openings', 'middlegame', 'endgames', 'tactics'],
  maxGames: 1000,
  minRating: 2200
});
```

### Configuring Online Play
```typescript
// Configure for Lichess
trainingEngine.configureOnlinePlay(agent, {
  platform: 'lichess',
  username: 'my_chess_bot',
  timeControl: { initial: 600, increment: 5 }
});

// Play online games
const gameIds = await trainingEngine.playOnlineGame(agent, {
  platform: 'lichess',
  numberOfGames: 10,
  rated: true
});
```

### Running Master Training Program
```typescript
await trainingEngine.createMasterTrainingProgram(agent, {
  phase1: { 
    books: chessLiteratureLibrary.slice(0, 3), 
    games: 500 
  },
  phase2: { 
    onlinePlatforms: ['lichess', 'chess.com'], 
    gamesPerPlatform: 50 
  },
  phase3: { 
    tournamentRounds: 5, 
    opponents: [otherAgent1, otherAgent2] 
  }
});
```

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

### Knowledge Summary
```typescript
const knowledge = agent.getKnowledgeSummary();
console.log(`Total Knowledge: ${knowledge.totalKnowledge}`);
console.log(`Books Studied: ${knowledge.literature.booksStudied}`);
